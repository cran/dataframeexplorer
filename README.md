## Overview
```
It is often said that data manipulation alone takes 50-70% time of a data science project. 
The duration of this never-ending activity can be attributed to our opaqueness with datasets provided.
Functions in this package enable familiarity with the data.frame to further reduce coding errors and re-work.
```

## Installation
``` r
# The easiest way to get dplyr is to install from GitHub:
install.packages("dataframeexplorer")

# Alternatively, you can install development version:
install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ashrithssreddy/dataframeexplorer")
```

## Next Steps
```
Functions:
~~Percentiles~~

~~Message not printed in all codes~~
~~Default filename not consistent~~
Outputs not refined
Pep 8 formatting
examples not consistent
Comments not consistent across all codes
```

## Usage
